# ios-combineDemo

A small demo of the usage of the Combine framework. 

Using TheMovieDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch data.
This demo leverages the usage of MVVM and Factory patterns for the creation and setup of View Controllers, and Router classes to handle navigation.

It also has some tests specs (targetting the existing view models) using Nimble/Quick frameworks.
